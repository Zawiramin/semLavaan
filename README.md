# semLavaan
This is my final attempt to use Lavaan. I think I get it now as to how Lavaan works and how SEM in general works.

IMPORTANT SCRIPT:

1. recodeData.R 
=> explain and recoding items into numerical item for Lavaan analysis
=> handle missing values using MICE
=> data partitioning (if necessary for SEM)

2. step1.R
=> loading all necessary packages
